        Hello!
        To start with this is just an introduction to Flo’s signs but we mean to build it up into a dictionary where you can also look them up and post questions.

        Flo uses Signalong, mostly, with some Makaton from Mr Tumble and a few variations of her own.
        Her signs are sometimes hard to distinguish, so we hope these little videos will help.

          Only the clips on the right are working today; the search is coming soon and more guides will follow.

          Find a sign
        %p
          Begin a word here and we'll show relevant suggestions from Flo's 150-200 signs.

          %input.twothirds{type: "text", name: "q", placeholder: "word or situation", disabled: true}>

          Check a sign
        %p
          If Flo is using a sign you don’t recognise, take a short video and upload it here. We don’t always know either but we’ll try to work it out.

        %form.query<
          %input.third{type: "text", name: "name", placeholder: "Your name", disabled: true}>
          %input.third{type: "text", name: "email", placeholder: "email", disabled: true}>
          %input.third{type: "submit", disabled: true, value: "video"}>
